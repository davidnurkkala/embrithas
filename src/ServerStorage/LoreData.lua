"When you look into the night sky, what do you see? Islands of light on a vast sea of blackness. Since time immemorial, a Goddess has journeyed from star to star, searching for beautiful things. A long time ago, she happened upon a jewel unlike any she'd ever seen -- our world. Unique among the worlds she'd seen for its magic, she knew it needed protection, and so she created what we call "mortals" -- which includes you and I -- to watch over it. She enjoyed the bounty she'd found with her creations for a time, but then resumed her journey to find its equal. One day, she will return, but for now she is far away. That brightest star that hangs in the east? That is her: the Distant Goddess. For an age we mortals treated our ward with respect, using its magic only to amplify its beauty and to care for one another. However, in the ancient land of Embrithas, one mortal suggested the use of magic for greed and gain. They are known now only as the Selfish One, and they were banished to the west -- to a barren land called Lorithas. Soon, life sprang up in Lorithas, as well as terrifying wonders of imposing scale. A city was being built, and mortals from across the world flowed to Lorithas to join in the ambitions of the Selfish One. One day, however, they drew too deeply and too darkly of the magic of our world, and the Great Corruption occurred. The cities of Lorithas were destroyed and the magically-sustained lands were ravaged. To this day it is called the Land of Ruin. But the most terrible consequences were reserved for the mortals that called that land home. They were twisted and malformed by their misuse of our world's gift. They became the first monsters, and they have been the greatest trouble of our world since."]]

	theOrderOfPurifiers = {
		Title = "The Order of Purifiers",
		Content = [[The Order of Purifiers are the oldest, largest, and, historically, most popular group of monster slayers in the world. Almost immediately following the Great Corruption, various sects of devout Distant Goddess worshippers convened to formulate a response to the incoming threat of monsters. A new monastic order was founded during 4A3 and is, to this day, guided by a council of eight abbots and abbesses.

The Order is known for their stalwart and unyielding defense of any mortal regardless of creed or perceived worthiness of protection. They do their best to maintain utter agnosticism in all political matters, living only to defend mortals from monsters in the name of the Distant Goddess. Their long term goal is to cleans the world of monsters and corruption before the prophesied return of the Goddess, but even with their mighty faith they can do naught but hold against the tide of aberrations flowing out of Lorithas.

In modern times the Order of Purifiers has been criticized for defending nations which have committed egregious actions against their neighbors, such as the Jolian Empire with their aggressive territorial expansionism. The Order's response has, as it always has, been "we answer the call of anyone in the name of the Distant Goddess." For decades, however, it has been a well-used political tactic to inform the Order of monster incursions selectively so as to put pressure on rivals or allow military resources to be focused elsewhere.

Despite all of this, the staunch idealism of the Purifiers continues to attract mortals seeking for stability and purity of focus. They will fight and die for their fellow mortal and the Distant Goddess, and they will purify the world's corruption -- so long as that corruption isn't other mortals, of course.]]

		Content = [[The College of Reclamation is the latest group to be accepted into the Slayer Alliance. Their youth is exceeded only by their eccentricity, for their purposes are enigmatic and their actions vague. What is known is that they are most interested in slaying monsters as an intellectual pursuit. They are collectors of knowledge, and they are well known for capturing and experimenting upon the twisted denizens of Lorithas before dispatching them.

Of all the groups in the Slayer Alliance, the College is the most brazen when leading expeditions into Lorithas proper, usually seeking relics, artifacts, and knowledge which will be used, they assure the Alliance, to further the fight against monsters. As for whether that will remain true is to be seen, but for now they truly have developed many revolutionary weapons and techniques which have spurred the Alliance towards many new victories.

Founded only a decade prior to the time of this writing, the College is led by a board of wizards, professors, and researchers across the globe. They have very little centralized power, and membership requires only the research, development, writing, and review of a thesis on some monster-related field of study. In this way, many curious, driven, and ambitious mortals from across the world are drawn to the College for its transparent hierarchy and loose rules. Though it is criticized by many (the Order of Purifiers in particular), the College continues its research into the darkest secrets of Lorithas.]]

		Title = "The League of Valor",
		Content = [[The League of Valor is surely the strangest of groups in the Slayer Alliance. They were never really founded, nor do they have a real leader. Instead, ranking is determined by the perceived valor of one's deeds in the fight against monsters. Members of the League see monster hunting as the ultimate form of sport or entertainment, and their aim is to fight and win in epic battles against the forces of darkness. One of the few rules of the League is that you may not tell your own stories, so in order to advance in the voted rankings, members go on expeditions in groups large enough to survive but small enough not to have to share too much glory.

It could be argued that the League was founded when the first entry was written into the Tome of Valor, but it is not particularly one book. Rather, it is an abstract collection of writings, oral accounts, leaderboards, and trophies that tell the stories of League members past to present. Something is considered to have been written into the Tome of Valor not by any official process but rather by a loose group decision. Frustrating to some, the League of Valor is truly ran "by feeling."

Those that join the League are motivated by fame, boredom, and camaraderie alike. Whether you're looking to become a legend, ignite the fires of true excitement in your heart again, or just be surrounded by a boisterous group of very violent friends, the League is the place for you.]]

The stone of this area is of fine enough quality for decent construction. An expansive wall may be out of the question, but a sufficiently large tower on a vantage point may be enough to secure the stretch of land and prevent Kakastan incursion. The foundation is set already, and we're already five meters off the ground. I'd like to request additional troops to help keep track of the native workers. Even for pay they don't much like that they're building fortifications to keep them off the territory they lost, and I don't blame 'em, but until we can get a lot more colonists onto this continent from the motherland they'll have to do. We don't want to lose this chokepoint over a worker riot, do we?]]

Arinthari golemcraft has been lost since the beginning of the fourth age, but many of the imposing constructs still remain. They were first devised as a line of defense against monsters, but the nation has been unaffected by the Great Corruption for so long that they simply deemed it unnecesary to continue their costly construction. Instead, they now serve as cultural artifacts -- a connection to the past, great geomancers whose ancient wisdom surpassed even modern knowledge.]]

		Title = "Iskis: a Summary",
		Content = [[Iskis is an enigmatic nation of semi-nomadic druids that migrate twice a year between two permanent settlements. During the Summer months, they remain at the northern end of the island around a large lake settled between the trees of the forest that dominates their land. When Winter comes, the Iskith people move south to a settlement built on the side of the island nation's other major landmark: a massive volcano. The volcanic hot springs there are a grand boon during the harsh snowfall of the colder months.

This cycle of movement reflects the Iskith focus on the cycle of life and death. They're aware they're on the edge of destruction at any time -- their volcano could burn their forest to the ground -- but they know that they, like the forest, will grow back from any devasation. It's because of this that the Iskith export many magical tools focused on life as well as a great deal of lumber from their abundant supply.

Known for being a happy people, the Iskith try to practice balance in all things, inspired by the way their strange island home is balanced between abundance and destruction as the plumes of volcanism cast shadows on their vivacious forest. Mortals from across the world travel there to experience both of the lifestyles the Iskith practice: a calm drift on a pleasant wooded lake or a cozy dip into a refreshing hot spring.]]

	aTheoryOnShadows = {
		Title = "A Theory on Shadows",
		Content = [[To my peers, colleagues, and betters at the College of Reclamation,

It has been supposed and accepted by many scholars of the College that the natures of the monsters from Lorithas are related to the lives of the mortals that were transformed by the Great Corruption. The Jukumai, for example, are masters of death because before they were corrupted they were seeking to use worldstone to extend their lives and thus avoid the demise that all mortals face. Likewise, the ugly, infectious duplicity of the Orcs is thought to have been created by a shallow mage obsessed with his or her own looks to the point of forcing all other living things to look like him or her (and failing spectacularly).

What then, can we posit about the mysterious shadow mortals (abbreviated henceforth merely as "shadows")? It is the assertion of the author that the shadows are unique among monsters. While many came to Lorithas seeking strength, knowledge, fame, fortune, and other vices, others, in theory most of the Lorithasi, simply thought of the doomed nation as another place to live. Before traveling to the Land of Ruin, they were regular folk: business people, guardsmen, common criminals. The kind of people that blend into the background. Common people. Invisible to most, but leading normal (if not upstanding) lives. This trait -- their overarching desire to simply fade into the noise of society -- is what defines shadows.

This, too, would explain the strange incorruptedness of these creatures. The reader may already know that many of the former Lorithguard carry weapons infused with worldstone -- the very seedbed of corruption -- and yet these samples remain oddly pure and untouched by the malaise of Lorithas. However, if one considers that the shadows are not perpetrators nor innocents to the crime of the Great Corruption, then it begins to make sense. While others actively sought to leverage worldstone without caution, it is the theory of the author that shadows were mere bystanders to the ambitions of the elites of their nation. Caught up in the destruction they were tragically not responsible for, but still party to enough such that they were transformed forever. A pity! But a fascinating one.

Gratefully,
Byrus Elzalar, Professor of Lorithasi Studies at Hestingrav University]]

		Title = "On Elt",

The amphibious denizens are unique, being extremely sensitive to sunlight and having almost no discernable difference between men and women. Most live in half-submerged villages beneath the shade of the mangroves of their home, and those that dare venture out of their marshy home often wear clothing that fully covers their body and head.

Eltan culture is not completely impenetrable to outsiders, however -- they are, in fact, a very hospitable people. Many Eltans are devout followers of the Distant Goddess, to the point where one of the famous Eight Abbeys of the Order of Purifiers stands proud in Elt before the gaping maw of the Great Chasm. They built the Abbey of the Chasm so that they could worship with their aquatically-challenged brothers and sisters.

Its people being very communal, Elt is mostly unpopulated wilderness. It is strikingly beautiful in its own way, and many explorers trawl its shallow waters for treasures of a lost age.]]
